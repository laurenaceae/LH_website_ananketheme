title: 'UCSB Intro Bio Plant Photography'
---

During the height of COVID, UCSB needed a way to show their Intro Bio students the plants they were learning about instead of using in-person labs. They developed a website showcasing various plant species found at the UCSB greenhouse and campus. 

As a UCSB greenhouse assistant, I was tasked with photographing many of the plant species displayed on this website. We were given a light box and other camera equipment to produce product-style photos and were expected to also edit the photos. Additionally, we dissected some of the plants being photographed to give students a better understanding of their anatomy. 

The website itself was created by UCSB. I worked alongside Cameron Hannah-Bick and Gavin Thatcher to produce most of the photos. Other photos on the website come from Ganna Walska Lotusland (Anna Bower), United States Botanic Garden (Chelsea McKinley), and University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee (Paul Engevold).
