title: 'Artificial Upwelling: A Solution for Carbon Sequestration?'

__How Artificial Upwelling Works__

Artificial upwelling (AU) works to increase the productivity of phytoplankton in the ocean, causing the absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. More specifically, AU promotes the upwelling of deep nutrient-rich seawater in order to introduce nutrients to the surface waters. This increases the amount of limiting nutrients available for phytoplankton to uptake, raising primary production in the upper ocean and consuming carbon in the process (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2021). The phytoplankton then die and sink to the ocean floor which sequesters the carbon, or alternatively, the phytoplankton get absorbed into higher trophic levels by predation. In addition to effects on the carbon cycle, phytoplankton produce methyl sulfide which stimulates cloud formation and helps Earth reduce incoming radiation (Lovelock and Rapley 2007). Methods to achieve upwelling include pumps to physically move water or the creation of salinity or temperature gradients to foster mixing. 

__Financial Cost__

Some studies have estimated costs for different methods of AU implementation. Kirke (2003) estimated that a “moored 500-m-deep, 12.9-m-diameter, wave-driven inertial pump made of carbon steel” would cost $7 million, with the total cost with floats, anchors, and more coming out to $15 million in 2022 USD. Salt-fountain style pumps made of plastic and concrete were estimated to cost a minimum of $40 million in 2022 USD (Johnson and Decicco 1983). 
The cost to scale-up this method after research and development is moderate to high: one ton of CO2 sequestration will cost $100-$150, not including monitoring and verification costs during R&D (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2021). However, the confidence in this estimate is low because the current technology is not ready to achieve AU even on small scales. 

__Case Study__

White et al. (2010) utilized a wave-pump in order to test AU in the open ocean. A wave-pump is powered by natural ocean movement and was first conceived by John D. Isaacs (1976). A length of tubing is attached to a buoy at the ocean surface, with the end of the tubing reaching below the euphotic zone. The tubing has unidirectional movement upwards, keeping seawater from falling back down the tube. In 2008, White et al. deployed the wave-pump off of Oahu. The pump functioned for 17 hours before catastrophic failure. The biggest issues were materials-based; the keel, the tube material, and the welds all needed improvement. The authors were not able to record the horizontal distribution of the water or the settling depth caused by the wave-pump, both important factors in determining wider impacts of AU. Additionally, the wave-pump was significantly less efficient at moving the seawater than predicted by previous studies. This experiment is evidence of the extensive technological improvements needed to accomplish AU. 

__Advantages and Disadvantages__

The main advantage of AU is the reduction of atmospheric CO2, but there are a number of co-benefits in addition to this. For example, AU can provide cold water for air-conditioning (Hernández-Romero et al. 2019), reduce the intensity and frequency of typhoons and storms (Kirke 2003; Webster et al. 2005), help generate energy (Isaacs et al. 1976), and decrease the rate of coral bleaching using localized cooling (Sawall et al. 2020). 
One such proposed co-benefit is that AU can sustain fisheries and ocean aquaculture (Kirke 2003). However, trophic effects are notoriously hard to predict and changes to food webs can have unintended consequences (Grubbs et al. 2016). 
Some challenges of AU have already been predicted, such as the high cost and lack of technological readiness. One main limitation of AU is it requires that CO2 degassing be outweighed by absorption. Water from the deep ocean contains higher levels of dissolved CO2 compared to surface waters because of higher rates of decomposition and less mixing with the atmosphere (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2021). Introducing this CO2-rich water to the surface may cause degassing of CO2 into the atmosphere. It is imperative that research is done on the best sites for AU with consideration of ocean chemistry and phytoplankton biology. 
Another concern of AU is that it may increase ocean acidification, having impacts on marine life and consequently on human life. Williamson and Turley (2012) claim that the absorption of carbon into the ocean system can lower the pH from interactions between carbon, carbonate, bicarbonate and water. 
Oschlies et al. (2010) proposed that AU would need to be done continuously, as stopping AU practices would lead to rapid warming. The final temperature after this effect could be even higher than if there was no AU to begin with. This is because it perturbs Earth’s planetary energy balance; if Earth’s surface becomes colder, it will emit less thermal energy back into space. 
Finally, Siegel et al. (2021) modeled time scales of sequestration strategies to determine their permanence. It was found that AU would lose 70% of the sequestered carbon back to the surface in 50 years. AU is not a long-term strategy. 

__Policy and Government__

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP 10 Decision X/33 states that no geoengineering activity related to the climate will be adopted should the activity affect biodiversity. However, if extensive research has been done to justify the risks and take into consideration social, economic and cultural impacts (COP 2010) then it may be implemented. While this is not a binding agreement, it is highly recommended that all 197 parties informed by the UNFCCC, including the U.S., follow these guidelines. 
Legally, AU may be a challenge in the United States. The U.S. has numerous laws concerning environmental review, coastal and ocean management, ocean dumping and seabed use. One such area of the law concerns vulnerable species. AU is a massive disruption to the natural environment and could have extensive effects on wildlife, including species which are threatened or endangered. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires that actions by federal agencies do not negatively impact the existence of any threatened or endangered species (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2021). NOAA must consult with other governmental agencies regarding potential impacts on vulnerable species. It will be very time-consuming and expensive to gain approval. 


__Environmental Justice__

The location of AU implementation is more likely to occur near less privileged people. This means that any negative effects of AU, such as unintended trophic cascades, are first going to affect the health and livelihoods of disadvantaged people. Such effects can be minimized by involving local people in the implementation of AU technology in order to safely and equitably deploy this solution (Suarez and van Aalst 2017). However, stakeholder involvement cannot solve the multitude of known issues with AU safety and efficacy which will still have disproportionate impacts on vulnerable people. 

__Summary Recommendation__

Artificial upwelling (AU) is unlikely to be a viable solution for climate change. It is not feasible with the current technology. It is also a relatively expensive solution. Politically and legally, the U.S. is unlikely to approve AU because of its strong impacts on biodiversity. AU is also at great risk of unintended environmental consequences such as ocean acidification and increased warming from an altered Earth energy balance. AU also requires continuous use which risks further warming at higher rates on cessation. Additionally, the impermanence of AU carbon sequestration shows that this solution is inefficient. All of these risks combine to have a disproportionate impact on disadvantaged populations that cannot fully be mitigated by stakeholder involvement. It is not recommended that NOAA adopt AU as a carbon sequestration strategy.
