title: 'Chaparral Seed Bank Project'
---

The purpose of this project is to determine the best methods to germinate 19 chaparral plant species to better equip restorationists with the tools needed to analyze seed banks. Fire cues tested include charate, smoke, and two levels of heat (high-intensity and shorter-term heat, and low-intensity and longer-term heat). This study utilized both a viability stage of seeds in Petri dishes, and a greenhouse test to measure germination rates of seeds in soil. 

Related public speaking:
- Presented to 100-person audiences via live 10-minutes talk with 5-minute Q&A at the Worster Award Symposium (5/21)
- Gave pre-recorded 3-minute talk and poster for UCSB EEMB Senior Awards Ceremony (6/21)

This project is from my undergraduate thesis at UCSB. A manuscript for this project is currently in production.
