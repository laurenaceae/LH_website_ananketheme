title: 'GCC Native Plant Nursery Project'

The purpose of this project is to determine the feasibility of a native plant nursery in Gaviota, at Baron Ranch or elsewhere. A new native plant nursery would increase the supply of native plants regionally and directly supply restoration projects and native landscaping efforts. This nursery will also provide opportunities for community involvement. My recommendations for this potential nursery will be based off of interviews with stakeholders and rightsholders, analysis of hydrologic and financial data, and other avenues of research.
