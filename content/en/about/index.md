Lauren Harris received her Bachelor of Science in Ecology and Evolution with Distinction in the Major from the University of California, Santa Barbara In 2021. She is currently a graduate student at the Bren School working towards a Masters in Environmental Science and Management (MESM) with a specialization in conservation planning (expected 6/23). 

Lauren is particularly passionate about plant ecology in a landscape context. Plants are an integral part of terrestrial ecology; they are abundant, primary producers which influence and are influenced by the landscape. The goal is to use our insights on this relationship to better understand how to mitigate the effects of urbanization and climate change, and how to restore ecosystems already degraded by these factors.
