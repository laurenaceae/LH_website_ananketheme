Lauren Harris received her Bachelor of Science in Ecology and Evolution with Distinction in the Major from the University of California, Santa Barbara In 2021. She is currently a graduate student at the Bren School working towards a Masters in Environmental Science and Management (MESM) with a specialization in conservation planning (expected 6/23). 

Lauren is particularly passionate about plant ecology in a landscape context. Plants are an integral part of terrestrial ecology; they are abundant primary producers which influence and are influenced by the landscape. The goal is to use our insights on this relationship to better understand how to mitigate the effects of urbanization and climate change, and how to restore ecosystems already degraded by these factors. 

She is particularly skilled in ecological data analysis. Lauren has experience using R, QGIS, ArcGIS, and ArcMap for GIS-based analyses. Recent projects in this vein include the emLab/CI Agricultural Abandonment project, her Bren group project, and the Chaparral seed bank analysis. Manuscripts are currently in the works for the Agricultural Abandonment project and the Chaparral seed bank analysis.

In her free time, Lauren enjoys dancing Argentine tango, West Coast Swing, and Blues fusion. She is an avid photographer, mainly focusing on landscapes and macro plant photography, but has branched out into portraits (both human and pets) as well. Lauren also likes to spend time making spreadsheets, collecting and wearing indie perfumes, and birding.
